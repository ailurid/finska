# Finska

A simple application for keeping score so that more of your focus can stay on throwing a bit of wood at other bits of wood.

## TODO / Feedback / Ideas / Comments

- Undo/fix incorrectly entered score
  - undo solves several problems with retrospective score editing
- Next up unnecessary most of the time, as long as:
  - score is entered correctly
  - player is not eliminated
- Display points to win, especially if achievable in the current throw
- Numpad for score entry rather than 0-12 buttons? (probably won't do)
- Bigger buttons for tipsy fingers
- Switch between score entry and leaderboard views
- Keep game state, scores etc in local storage in case of unexpected page reload
- Not another blue app bar, so basic
- Features requiring a backend
  - Jackbox-style game code
    - splash/landing page to start new game or enter code of ongoing/completed game
    - join as scorer? if multiple scorers allowed, need to protect against conflicting scores being entered
    - scoreboard/watch-only mode
- Shameless promotion link
